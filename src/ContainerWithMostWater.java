/**
 * 11. Container With Most Water
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
 * <p>
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
 * n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
 * Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 * <p>
 * Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
 * <p>
 * The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 * Output: 49
