 * <p>
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
 * <p>
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 * The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
 * <p>
 * How many possible unique paths are there?
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
 * <p>
 * Note: m and n will be at most 100.
